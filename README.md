# Tusmo Player

## About
**Tusmo** is a web game inspired by the French game show **Motus**, which is similar to **Wordle**. This project features a player bot that operates using **Selenium**.

**Note:** The bot may occasionally stop working, which can cause the whole instance to crash. I'm still trying to fix this issue.

## Demo

```
