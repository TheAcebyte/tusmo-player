# Tusmo Player

## About
**Tusmo** is a webgame inspired by the French gameshow **Motus**, which is similar to **Wordle**.

This project implements a player bot which runs on **Selenium**.

**WARNING:** the bot sometimes stops working, which causes the whole instance to crash out. I'm still working on fixing this bug, it's driving me crazy.

## Demo

```
git clone https://github.com/TheAcebyte/tusmo-player.git
